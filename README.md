# Agentic AI Projects Repository

Welcome to the **Agentic AI Projects** repository! This repository demonstrates experiments, prototypes, and production-ready applications built using **Agentic AI frameworks**. The focus is on autonomous agents capable of reasoning, planning, and executing multi-step tasks across APIs, datasets, and digital environments.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

**Agentic AI** represents the next generation of AI systems where agents act autonomously to accomplish complex goals. Unlike traditional LLM applications, agentic AI systems:

- Reason over multiple steps
- Plan actions dynamically
- Interact with APIs, databases, and users
- Orchestrate multiple AI agents in workflows

This repository showcases implementations using:

- **Crew AI** â€“ Multi-agent coordination and workflow automation
- **Microsoft AutoGen** â€“ Auto-generated reasoning pipelines for tasks
- **LangChain Agents** â€“ Orchestrate language models with tools and memory
- **AutoGPT** â€“ Self-prompting AI agents that can plan and execute tasks
- **BabyAGI** â€“ Lightweight autonomous agent framework for goal-driven tasks
- **Custom Agentic Solutions** â€“ Integrations with web search, databases, and file systems

## ðŸ›  Features

- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Combine several AI agents to solve complex tasks.
- **Autonomous Reasoning**: Agents can plan multi-step solutions without human intervention.
- **Tool Integration**: Connect agents to APIs, databases, web scrapers, and local tools.
- **Interactive Demos**: Streamlit apps or web interfaces to test agent capabilities.
- **Customizable Workflows**: Define task-specific agents or chain agents dynamically.
